# Classifying-CIFAR10
The aim of this project was to construct a basic AI model that can classify images. 
As I dive into learning how to program in AI, this was one of the most basic 
projects I could take on to learn the basics of using Pytorch to create the
structure of a nerual network.

# Data 
For this project, I used the CIFAR10 dataset of 32x32 pixel images. This is a set 
of 60,000 images which each falls into one of the following categories: Airplane, 
automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, or truck. The data was divided 
into 50,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing. 

# Model Structure
This model consists of a convolutional neural network with two convolutional 
layers and three linear layers. It uses Stochastic Gradient Decent and Cross Entropy 
Loss functions to calculate the loss and gradients of the model through 4 epochs. 

# Results
The results of the model ranged from an accuracy of 8.6% to 70.8% for each category. 
Even though the accuracy of the model was not ideal, the priority of the project 
was not accuracy, rather the learning process to create the model. 

# Credits 
I did not come up with this code. It is a mix of the code of the following
